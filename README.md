## I have added the dependencies of the Firebase authentification 
 pubspec.yaml
 firebase_auth: 5.4.1
 firebase_core: 3.10.1
 firebase_database: 11.3.1
 
then i did 
## flutter pub get 
To update the dependencies.

## Email test@gmail.com
### Password 123456


## Need to check for 
- Sign Up ( inside the main.dart)
- forgot password ( inside the main.dart)
- sorting for the ruche needs to be done for the ruche.dart


## for admin Page
- sorting for all the pages needs to be done. 
- adding new apiculteur adds api8 instead of api_008 (apiculteur_listpage.dart)
- for the admin i need to see for the profile page. the password change is also not working as its not being stored inside the real time database. its only handled with the auth of firebase.
